<p>It isn&#8217;t some kind of issue with youtube. </p>
<p><span>For the first few hundred views, they increment in realtime. Beyond that viewcounts update, at slowest, every few hours and often more quickly, but not in realtime. This has to do with their methodology for ensuring that spam/invalid views are not counted since they take view count seriously. </span></p>
